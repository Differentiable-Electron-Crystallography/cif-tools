//! Value parsing logic.
//!
//! This module is a placeholder for value-specific parsing logic. Currently,
//! value parsing is handled directly by `CifValue::parse_value()`. This module
//! exists to provide a place for future enhancements like:
//! - Span tracking for error reporting
//! - Value validation based on context
//! - Custom parsing hooks
